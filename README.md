my personal website
i created this using Code Acadamy with their free online course "Deploy a website"
my goal was to create a free site to no longer have to use a wix domain (username.wix.com/sitename) 
but instead i ended up making a "Dummy" site and using my username again, i dont have the money to pay for a domain
